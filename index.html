      <p>
        Love can sometimes feel like an exhausting dance as you step towards
        connection, love and intimacy – only to then take a step back because
        you feel smothered and need to regain your space.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re often very generous with your energy, time and support because of
        your empathetic nature. But sometimes you can “over-give”, feeling like
        you’ve been taken advantage of and that your needs, wants and opinions
        don’t really matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a fearful avoidant, your superpower is your ability to read other
        people. But this also means that you might overanalyze your partner’s
        behavior, micro-expressions and body language – always scanning for
        signs of betrayal and feeling uneasy.
      </p>
      <p>
        You set impossibly high standards for yourself because you believe you
        need to be perfect before you can be fully loved. You’re also prone to
        feeling excessive guilt, which only reinforces your belief that
        something is wrong with you.

          “I’ve researched relationships most of my life. However, I couldn’t
          find anything that explained my dynamic in them. I thought about
          therapy until I stumbled upon Thais’s YouTube channel. She explained
          EXACTLY what I was experiencing. She literally read my mind! I’m
          usually a bit of a skeptic but I was hooked! I finally figured out my
          problem and how to solve it!”
